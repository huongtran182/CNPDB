## Welcome to cNPDB: The Crustacean Neuropeptide Database

Neuropeptides are cell-to-cell signaling molecules involved in numerous physiological processes, including metabolism, development, reproduction, and behavior. They are highly conserved both structurally and functionally across the animal kingdom, making the neuropeptide study in simple invertebrate models advantageous for gaining insights into basic neurobiology principles, drug discoveries, and functional investigations that are translatable to mammalian systems. Crustaceans are profound model organisms for neuropeptide studies and have long been used to investigate the robustness of rhythmic central pattern generator, feeding behavior, and neural responses to external stimuli.

Despite their significance, crustacean neuropeptides remain underrepresented in existing neuropeptide databases. To address this gap, we introduce the Crustacean Neuropeptide Database (cNPDB) – A comprehensive resource for neuropeptide research in crustacean species. cNPDB systematically curates experimentally confirmed and predicted neuropeptides from various crustacean species using genome-derived in silico mining, peer-reviewed literature, mass spectrometry-based peptidomics, and public protein databases. This database provides detailed annotations and sequences to support a range of endeavors, including comparative neurobiology, functional studies, education, and computational peptide discovery.

## TOOLS AND FEATURES

The current release of cNPDB (Version 1.0, 2025) contains 1364 curated neuropeptide entries from 29 crustacean species, organized into 55 neuropeptide families. Some representative species include Homarus americanus (American Lobster), Callinectes sapidus (Blue Crab), Cancer borealis (Jonah Crab), Carcinus maenas (European green crab), and Panulirus interruptus (California spiny lobster). cNPDB offers various tools that facilitate functional investigation, evolutionary analysis, and synthetic peptide design:

- **Custom Search Engine** – Find neuropeptides by sequence, species, families, tissues, post-translational modifications (PTMs), and desired peptide physiological properties, with an option to download the resulted FASTA file.
- **Sequence Alignment & Homology Search** – Identify conserved motifs and sequence similarities.
- **Peptide Property Calculator** – Compute GRAVY scores, hydrophobicity, instability index, and other physiological properties.

Each cNPDB search entry provides:

- Neuropeptide sequence (downloadable FASTA format)
- cNPDB ID
- Neuropeptide Family
- Species taxonomy
- Existence (MS/MS, De novo Sequencing, Predicted)
- Physicochemical properties (monoisotopic mass, length, hydrophobicity, instability index, isoelectric point, net charge, etc.)
- Post-translational modifications (PTMs)
- Predicted 3D Structure
- Experimental Mass Spectrometry Imaging data of the peptide showing their spatial distribution in tissues

## DATABASE SOURCE AND CURATION

cNPDB integrates data from peer-reviewed studies and public proteomics repositories:

- Experimental Data: Mass spectrometry and other bioassays
- Literature Mining: Curated from PubMed and primary research papers
- Public Databases: Cross-linked with UniProt, NCBI, and NeuroPep
- Computational Predictions: In silico prediction from genomics data

Every neuropeptide entry undergoes manual examination to ensure accuracy and reliability.

## FUTURE UPDATES
As genomic and experimental data become available for more crustacean species, new entries will be added to our database. Additional bioinformatics tools will be developed for tailored mass spectrometric data analysis to support the discovery and identification of neuropeptides. Experimental data provided by the community will be uploaded promptly upon receipt.
